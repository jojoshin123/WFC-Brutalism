# WFC-Brutalism
Experimenting with wave function collapse (WFC) algorithm with Blender.

# Background
This project is to gain familiarity with [mxgmn's Markov Junior](https://github.com/mxgmn/MarkovJunior) and [kaya3's MJr language](https://github.com/kaya3/MJr)

Ideally, I would like to perform a proper wave function collapse algorithm using actual 3D models, but currently I am only using WFC to generate a 2D "base plate", and then populating custom Blender floor & wall components around that base plate.
