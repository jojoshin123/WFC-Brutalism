# Background
This project is to gain familiarity with [mxgmn's Markov Junior](https://github.com/mxgmn/MarkovJunior) and [kaya3's MJr language](https://github.com/kaya3/MJr)

The goal is just to develop a base plate using these WFC algorithms and iterate on that base plate using custom Blender floor & wall models.
